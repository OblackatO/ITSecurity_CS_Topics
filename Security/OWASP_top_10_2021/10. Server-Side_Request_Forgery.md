# Server-Side Request Forgery
Quick overview of OWASP [Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/).


## Explanation over
- SSRF flaws **occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.** It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).


## How to prevent
### Network Layer
- Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks to reduce the impact of SSRF
- Enforce “deny by default” firewall policies or network access control rules to block all but essential intranet traffic.
  - Hints:
    - Establish an ownership and a lifecycle for firewall rules based on applications.
    - Log all accepted and blocked network flows on firewalls

### Application Layer
- Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data
- Enforce the URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow list
- Do not send raw responses to clients
- Disable HTTP redirections


## Example Attack scenarios
- Nothing to sum up. See **Example Attack Scenarios** of [Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/).
