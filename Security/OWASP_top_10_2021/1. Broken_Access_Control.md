# Broken Access Control
Quick overview of OWASP [Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

## Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)
- [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)
- [CWE-201: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/201.html)
- [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

## 5 Notable examples
- **Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default**, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
- **Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL** (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.
- **Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier** (insecure direct object references)
- **Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.**
- Metadata manipulation, such as **replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.**

## How to prevent
- Except for public resources, **deny by default.**
- **Implement access control mechanisms once** and re-use them throughout the application, including **minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage**.
- **Log access control failures**, alert admins when appropriate (e.g., repeated failures).
- **Rate limit API** and controller access to **minimize the harm from automated attack** tooling.
- **Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout.** **Stateless JWT tokens should rather be short-lived so that the window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized.** For longer lived JWTs it's highy recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.

## Example Attack scenarios
- Nothing to sum up. See **Example Attack Scenarios** of [Broken access control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
