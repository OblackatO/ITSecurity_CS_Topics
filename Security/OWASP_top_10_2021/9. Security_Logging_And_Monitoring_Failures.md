# Cryptographic Failures
Quick overview of OWASP [Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/).

## Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)
- [CWE-778 Insufficient Logging](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)
- [CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
- [CWE-223 Omission of Security-relevant Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/223.html)
- [CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File.](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)


## 5 Notable examples
- Auditable **events**, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, **are not logged.**
- **Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.**
- Logs are **only stored locally.**
- Appropriate alerting thresholds and **response escalation processes are not in place or not effective.**
- The application cannot detect, escalate, or **alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time.**


## How to prevent
- Ensure that logs are generated in a format that log management solutions can easily consume.
- Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion, such as append-only database tables or similar.
- DevSecOps teams should establish effective monitoring and alerting such that suspicious activities are detected and responded to quickly.
- Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan, such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-61r2 or later.



## Example Attack scenarios
- Nothing to sum up. See **Example Attack Scenarios** of [Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/).
