# Insecure Design
Quick overview of OWASP [Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/).
New category in 2021. Difference between insecure design and insecure implementation.

## Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)
- [CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)
- [CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html)
- [CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/501.html)
- [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials.](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)


## 5 Notable examples *NOT provided in the OWASP post*
- Sensitive data unencrypted at rest.
- Logging messages that contain authentication tokens, user names, passwords, Credit card secret codes or other sensitive data.
- Usage of the same data structure for trusted and untrusted data.
- Unauthenticated access or denial by default policy not applied, to systems in charge of storing credentials and authentication services.
- Poor encryption algorithms used to encrypt data at transit or at rest.


## How to prevent
- Establish and use a **secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals** to help evaluate and design security and privacy-related controls.
- Establish and use a **library of secure design patterns or paved road ready to use components.**
- Write **unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are resistant to the threat model.** Compile use-cases and misuse-cases for each tier of your application.
- Integrate **plausibility checks at each tier of your application** (from frontend to backend)
- Limit resource consumption by user or service


## Example Attack scenarios
- Nothing to sum up. See **Example Attack Scenarios** of [Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/).
