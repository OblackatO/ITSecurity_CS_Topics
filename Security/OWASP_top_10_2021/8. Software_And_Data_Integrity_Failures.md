# Software and data integrity failures
Quick overview of OWASP [Software and data integrity failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/).

## Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)
- [CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)
- [CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)
- [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)

## 3 Notable examples
- An application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from **untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs)**
- An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for **unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise**
- Auto-update functionality, where **updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification** and applied to the previously trusted application


## How to prevent
- **Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.**
- Ensure that a **software supply chain security tool, such as OWASP Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX, is used** to verify that components do not contain known vulnerabilities
- Ensure that there is a **review process for code and configuration changes** to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into your software pipeline.
- Ensure that **unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to untrusted clients without some form of integrity check** or digital signature to detect tampering or replay of the serialized data


## Example Attack scenarios
- Nothing to sum up. See **Example Attack Scenarios** of [Software and data integrity failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/).
